![Game Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.10-green.svg)
This is a mod for Hearts of Iron 4 which builds a UI for a resolution of 1920x1080.

## Features

Here are the current features that the UI changes:
- **Tech Tree:**  
All Tech Trees no longer require scrolling! (except for the Man the Guns Naval tree, for obvious reasons)  
  
- **Commanders:**  
Trait Tree Window now shows all traits at once (For both generals _and_ Admirals)  
Assign Commander Window made taller  
  
- **War Overview:**  
Made taller to show more participants at once.  
  
- **Air Wings Interface:**  
Air Wings Window now displays a lot more wings at once  
Air Wing Creation & Air Wing Reorganization windows made much taller

- **Political View:**  
National Focus Details was embiggened  
Manage Subjects, Exiled Governments, and Occupied Territories windows made taller  
  
- **Recruit and Deployment View:**  
Division Templates list expanded to show more templates (10) without overlapping your general's portraits.  
Division Template View default position moved far right to stop overlapping template list, allowing quickly clicking through different templates.  
  
- **Combat View:**  
You can now see twice as many units (including reserves) in the battle window.  
  
- **World Tension Window:**  
Made taller.

## Contributing
If anyone out there has some modding experience and is willing to help out with this mod, I would appreciate the assistance. Patching for the new version is obviously the main thing, but also if you have any ideas for more UI edits then that's great also.
